# SEATALK_ATTINY85
 
_ Holding notes_
NOTE   !!! THIS DOES NOT WORK..!! 


This was an attempt at getting an ATTINY85 to recieve Seatalk (4800 baud - 9 bit) serial data so that I can do interesting things with some of the data. 

The initial idea is to use a modified version of software serial (https://github.com/zaners123/AVR8_BitBang_UART_TX) if possible.. to get the data.
After that we shall see what can be done with it.. !
